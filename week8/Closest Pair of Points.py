Closest pair of points

1) Several objects on screen 

2) Basic step: find closest pair of objects 

3) n objects â€” naive algorithm is n^2
	
	-> For each pair of objects, compute their distance 
	-> Report minimum distance across all pairs 

4) There is a clever algorithm that takes time O(nlogn) using divide and conquer

5) Given n points (p1, p2, p3,..., pn)  find the closest pair 

	-> Assume no two points have same  or  coordinate
	-> Split the points into two halves by vertical line 
	-> Recursively compute closest pair in each half 
	-> Compare shortest distance in each half to shortest distance across the dividing line 

6) Recurrence: 2T(n/2) + n

7) Overall: O(nlogn)
