'''
A thief robbing a store and can carry a maximum weight of W in his bag. There are n items in the
store with weights { } and corresponding values { }. What
items should he select to get maximum value? He cannot break an item, either he picks the
complete item or doesnâ€™t pick it.

Write a function MaxValue(Items, W) that accepts a dictionary Items , where the key of the
dictionary represents the item number (1 to n) and the corresponding value is a tuple (weight of
item, Value of item) . The function accepts one more integer W , which represents the
maximum weight capacity of the bag. The function returns the total value of all selected items,
which is maximum in all possible selection.

Explanation :
	The thief can pick items 2 and 3 where the total weight of picked items is 3 + 4 = 7 which is less
	than the maximum capacity of the bag, but he gets maximum value (60) for this selection.

# Solution code

def MaxValue(Items,W):
	(m, n) = (len(Items), W)
	c = []
	for i in range(m + 1):
		row = []
		for j in range(n + 1):
			row.append(0)
		c.append(row.copy())
	for i in range(1,m+1):
		for w in range(1,n + 1):
			if Items[i][0] > w:
				c[i][w] = c[i - 1][w]
			else:
				c[i][w] = max(c[i - 1][w],Items[i][1] + c[i - 1][w-Items[i][0]])
	return(int(c[m][n]))

You're given a list of tuples Activity for n activities, where in each tuple (activity_name, S,
F, P) , activity activity_name is scheduled to be done from start time S to finish time F and
obtains a profit of P after the finish.

Find out the maximum profit you can obtained by scheduled activities, but no two activities
should be in the subset with overlapping of time frame. If you choose an activity that finishes at
time x then another activity can be started at time x , not before that.

Write a function MaxProfit(Activity) that accepts a list of tuples Activity for n activities and
returns the value of maximum profit that can be obtained by scheduled activities.

Explanation :
	Consider input, 
		[('A',1,2,40),('B',3,4,5),('C',0,7,6),('D',1,2,3),('E',5,6,8),('F',5,9,2),
		('G',10,11,9),('H',0,11,35)]

	output, 
		62

	Activity schedule [A, B, E, G] gives a profit of 62 which is the maximum in all possible
	schedules.
